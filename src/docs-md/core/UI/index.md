<!-- id: UI -->
<!-- typings: ../../../../dist/core/typings/UI -->

The UI sub module is mostly made up of Component classes, each of which represents a different type of on-screen component. These components can be put together in your application to lay out pages (or modal dialogs, drawers, etc.) to display your application state and invite interaction.
