**Typescene** is a strongly typed front-end toolkit for modern Web applications built with TypeScript. It combines best practices from the realms of traditional desktop GUI development, mobile app development, and JavaScript web development in a single framework.

Why use Typescene for your Web apps?

* Single-source development: no need to switch among HTML, CSS and JS files.
* An intuitive object-oriented architecture, modeled after proven desktop GUI technology, mixed with convenient Javascript-isms where possible to keep things DRY.
* Transparent use of async programming concepts with predictable results: avoid 'magic' shared states, and donâ€™t favor functional paradigms over imperative logic.
* Strong typing with TypeScript 2+ for top-notch static type checks and IDE auto-complete for total API discoverability.
* Support for IE9+ and all modern browsers.

The result is a toolkit that encourages developers to write readable, coherent code in a single strongly-typed code base, while still taking advantage of the benefits that the modern browser JS environment offers.
