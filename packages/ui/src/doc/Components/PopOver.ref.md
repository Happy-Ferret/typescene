# PopOver

Mostly applied to buttons, see [`.popover`](#Button_popover) member of Button class.

## Note
<!-- type: note -->

Currently, the HTML implementation for popovers using Bootstrap 4 (beta) is broken. This issue will be fixed in the future by implementing custom styles and overriding Bootstrap positioning altogether.
