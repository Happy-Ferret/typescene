# ComponentFactory

Result of various static `.with*` methods. See `Component.with`.

## Note
<!-- type: note -->

You cannot create ComponentFactory instances directly; instead, use `.with*` methods to create factories, and apply them as initializers (see `Component/initializeWith` and `initializer`).
